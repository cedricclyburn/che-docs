= Viewing {devworkspace} Operator metrics from an OpenShift web console dashboard

After configuring the in-cluster Prometheus instance to collect {devworkspace} Operator metrics, you can view the metrics on a custom dashboard in the *Administrator* perspective of the OpenShift web console.

.Prerequisites

* An active `{orch-cli}` session with administrative permissions to the destination {orch-name} cluster. See {orch-cli-link}.

* An instance of {prod-short} running in {orch-name}.

* The in-cluster Prometheus instance is collecting metrics. See xref:proc_collecting-dev-workspace-operator-metrics-with-prometheus[].

.Procedure

. Create a ConfigMap in the `openshift-config-managed` {orch-namespace} containing the dashboard definition and apply the necessary label. The dashboard definition is based on Grafana 6.x dashboards, however, not all Grafana 6.x dashboard features are supported within the OpenShift web console.
